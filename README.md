# React Testing Cookbook

The definition of "legacy code" can be described simply as "code that doesn't have tests." Code you just wrote, 5 minutes ago? Legacy code. Code that can't be refactored, but only changed.

How do we prevent the mountain of legacy code that most projects become?

A solid testing strategy.

React apps are no different, and can be tested simply if you know some core principles.

In this course we will take a look at testing React applications. From getting setup and running tests, all the way through testing Redux enabled React applications.
